Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our team approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.


Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code âœ¨.

Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
We assign issues out to members of the team to work on. They then work to fix the issue.

Make Changes

Make changes locally
Clone the repository.

Create a new branch with the naming convention feature/[the issue you are trying to solve]

Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

You may be asked for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
Your PR is merged!


Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub repository.
